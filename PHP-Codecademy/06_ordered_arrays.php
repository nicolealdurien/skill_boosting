# ORDERED ARRAYS
# The array() function creates an array of the arguments passed
# to it, in the order they were passed in.
#
# PHP arrays can contain mixed data types in a single array.
#
# The built-in function count() will return the number of 
# elements in an array.
#
# We can also skip the array function and just use square brackets.
# This is known as 'short array syntax'.
#
# PRINTING ARRAYS
# To print an array, we must use print_r() instead of echo. This
# prints in a human-readable format.
# If we just want to print the elements, in the array, we can
# convert the array into a string using the implode() function. This
# takes two arguments:
# - a string to use between each element (the "glue"), usually ", "
# - the array to be joined together (the "pieces")
