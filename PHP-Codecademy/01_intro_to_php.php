# Laravel is a PHP framework.

# PHP is used to bulid dynamic web pages. 
# It can be used directly in-line within HTML.
# The start of inline PHP is denoted with <?php and ends with ?>
# echo is used to output text between double quotes.
# An instruction written in PHP is called a statement.
# A semicolon is required at the end of each PHP statement.

# PHP can also be executed from the terminal. 
# When writing PHP scripts, the beginning tag <?php is still required,
# but the closing tag is no longer required, and is usuallly 
# left out by convention.

# PHP generally ignores whitespace. It also is not case-sensitive.
# Comments in PHP can use either // or # to create a single-line comment.
# Multi-line uses /* */
