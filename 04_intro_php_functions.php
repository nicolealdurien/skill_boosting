# INTRO TO PHP FUNCTIONS
# PHP uses snake case for variable names BUT camel case for function names.
# Functions are defined and invoked the same way as in (pre-ES6) JS.
# function greet() {
#   echo "Sup!";
# }
# greet();
#
# RETURN STATEMENTS - same as JS.
# Any function without a return statement returns NULL.
# If you try to use NULL in mathematical operations, it functions as 0.
#
# PARAMETERS - same as JS.
